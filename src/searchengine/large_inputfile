WHEN a search engine guesses what you want before you finish typing it, or helpfully ignores your bad spelling, that is the result of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence. Although AI has been through cycles of hype and disappointment before, big technology companies have recently been scrambling to hire experts in the field, in the hope of building machines that can learn even more sophisticated tasks.

IBM said this month it would invest $1 billion in a new division to develop uses for Watson, its computer that understands human language. But this week Google cemented its lead in this field by paying around £400m ($660m) for DeepMind Technologies, a startup in London that has yet to announce a product.

The boss of DeepMind, Demis Hassabis, previously created video games such as “Evil Genius” and “Theme Park”, in which the events and characters can respond credibly in an enormous variety of potential situations because of an artificial-intelligence algorithm humming in the background.

DeepMind’s 75 geeks will join the world’s leading group of machine-learning experts, which Google has been assembling in the past few years. Google’s main source of income, its search engine and the accompanying ad-placement system, is driven by machine learning. The firm’s self-driving cars rely on it, as do the intelligent thermostats made by Nest, a firm it has just taken over, and the robots made by Boston Dynamics and other robotics outfits it has been buying.

The technology is already the backbone of many other internet firms. It is why Facebook and LinkedIn have that slightly creepy ability to find people you know, and why Amazon and Netflix are good at suggesting books and films you might like. It also helps intelligence agencies to identify terrorist networks.

As machine learning leaves the lab and goes into practice, it will threaten white-collar, knowledge-worker jobs just as machines, automation and assembly lines destroyed factory jobs in the 19th and 20th centuries. For example, the technique has been applied by researchers at Stanford University to tell whether a biopsy of breast cells is highly cancerous, something that until now has required a human expert to assess.

Another of DeepMind’s founders, Shane Legg, has predicted that artificial intelligence running amok will be the biggest existential risk to humans in this century. Its founders have asked Google to set up an “ethics board” to consider the appropriate use of machine learning in its products. The creator of “Evil Genius” is ensuring that his new overlord sticks to its motto, “Don’t be evil”.

He also warned about the implications for uncontrolled mass surveillance if computers were taught to recognise human faces.
Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “There’s a variety of short term risks for artificial intelligence, everyone knows about the autonomous drones.
“But there’s also the potential for mass surveillance, you don’t just have to recognise cat images, you could also recognise human faces and also mass unemployment in a variety of professions.”
He added: “We have some studies looking into which jobs are the most vulnerable and there’s quite a lot of them in logistics, administration, insurance underwriting but ultimately a huge swathe of jobs are potentially vulnerable to improved artificial intelligence.”
His concerns were backed up by Murray Shanahan, professor of cognitive robotics at Imperial College London, who said: “I think it is a very good thing that Google has set up this ethics board and I think there certainly are some short term issues that we all need to be talking about.
“It’s very difficult to predict and that is of course a concern but in the past when we’ve developed new kinds of technologies then often they have created jobs at the same time as taking them over but it certainly is something we ought to be discussing.”
DeepMind was founded two years ago by 37-year-old neuroscientist and former teenage chess prodigy Demis Hassabis, along with Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman.
The company specialises in algorithms and machine learning for simulation, e-commerce and games.
It is also working in an area called Deep Learning in which machines are taught to see patterns from large quantities of data so computers could start to recognise objects from daily life such as cars or food products and even human faces.
It is believed Google will use DeepMind’s expertise to improve the functions of its current products such as the Google Glass and extend its current artificial intelligence work such as the development of self-driving cars.
Mr Shanahan said: “We all know that Google have got an interest in wearable computing with their Google glass and you can imagine them and other companies using this technology to build some kind of assistant that for example could help you to make a lasagne in your kitchen and to tell you what ingredients you needed and where to find them.
“Not necessarily a robot assistant but something wearable such as your Google glass or some other maker might make a similar thing so you can carry it around with you.”

We know you will find a great deal of information here that will help you whether you are deciding to join us for years of training or an evening at the theater.
It was very important for you to find a faculty, student body, environment, and philosophy that "fit" with your talents and dreams as you decide which college to attend. Much of what has attracted us to this program is likely to attract you:

University of Miami Theatre is strictly an undergraduate training program.

Our students study directly with Professors, not graduate assistants. Our Professors remain active in the profession working in the country's leading regional theaters, in New York, and in film and television. Our students do not take a back seat to graduate students in casting, design assignments, directing opportunities, or in research opportunities.
Our student to teacher ratio is very low.

We offer the kind of personal attention one associates with traditional theatrical mentorship. We know that the keystone to a superior education is an excellent student/mentor relationship.
First-rate productions are a part of our over-all curriculum.

All of our programs contribute to fully produced seasons at our Jerry Herman Ring Theatre, one of Southern Florida's most respected cultural centers. Additional projects are mounted in our fully equipped studio theater.
This undergraduate degree in theater serves the student as a broad base for any career choice and for advanced graduate study.
We have a long and impressive record of alumni success.

View our Alumni Biography page to learn more about our graduates. This is an important and supportive professional community.
The University of Miami is in one of the nation's most beautiful cities, Coral Gables.

This lush tropical setting supports an equally lush professional arts community and a vibrant multi-cultural population. In recent years, the world entertainment industry has shifted focus from traditional professional centers to Southern Florida. Noted in Premiere magazine as one of the nation's new film centers, the greater Miami area offers students real world experience with the best of the entertainment industry.
We have an impressive roster of visiting artists and professionals.
We have equal commitment to our Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Fine Arts students.

A Bachelor of Arts Theater major receives experience in all the elements of the theater: acting, directing, technical design and production, dramatic structures, and the role of the audience as critic and consumer. These areas are enriched with study of dramatic literature, history, and a sense of the great movements in human thought and action. Additionally, the BA student experiences the breadth of the traditional Liberal Arts study.

This undergraduate degree in theater serves the student as a broad base for any career choice and for advanced graduate study.
A Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Theater offers more depth in the selected area of study and, perhaps, not quite as much breadth. This degree embraces its intention, which is professional preparation. While it is difficult to teach the artistic impulse or talent, it is important to provide students with the means to access their native talent through craft. A graduate of our BFA programs should expect to have been offered the skills that will make her/him competitive in the profession as it exists today.
In the end, your best college experience will depend on the "fit" of mentorship, environment, opportunity and your unique talents and dreams. Now that you have visited us on the web, we hope you will visit us in person and see first hand why so many prominent actors, directors and designers have found their best fit at the University of Miami. We look forward to meeting you!

When Java 8 ships on March 18, it will come equipped with a new JavaScript engine codenamed Nashorn. Created by Oracle, Nashorn enables Java developers to embed JavaScript in their applications and develop standalone JavaScript apps, all in the Java Virtual Machine.

JavaScript development on the JVM isn’t a new concept. Dating back to 1997, Netscape and then Mozilla developed and maintained the original JVM-based JavaScript engine, known as Rhino. Using the jrunscript command-line tool, Nashorn (pronounced “nas-horn,” the German word for rhinoceros) leverages new native APIs such as MethodHandles and InvokeDynamic to implement a lightweight, high-performance JavaScript runtime in Java.

At a presentation entitled “Java and JavaScript—Shaken, Not Stirred,” hosted by the New York Java Special Interest Group, Farata Systems senior software engineer Viktor Gamov explained how Nashorn aims to bridge the gap between Java and JavaScript.

“Nashorn is based off two worlds,” he said. “We can take the features we love in Java and use libraries from the JavaScript community.”

Gamov explained that for Java developers, JavaScript is like an iceberg. On top is a deceptively familiar syntax, but a completely unknown language awaits underneath. For Java developers who prefer to work in an environment in which they’re comfortable, Nashorn provides extension points for an application—the bridge between the two—to use JavaScript within the JVM for Web content generation.

Nashorn is the pure JavaScript implementation in the JVM, 100% written in Java and fully compatible with ECMAScript 5.1, the most recent standardized version of JavaScript.

“Compared to Rhino, Nashorn actually compiles JavaScript into byte code,” Gamov said. “You can add a new query with no compilation, and easily modify it or introduce new logic without recompilation.”

Oracle’s new JavaScript engine also borrows several features from Google Chrome’s V8 engine, using the same UI as the Chrome debugger and the same testing suite as V8. Gamov also pointed out that while Java templating is done on the server-side, today’s browser performance can execute JavaScript fast enough to do templating on the client-side. 

“I think there’s some perception out that Java is not as good anymore, but Java 8 will again make Java awesome,” Gamov said. “I can’t tell you to code Java or [a competing platform like] Node.js. But if I’m a developer who wants to stay in my comfort zone with a little bit of spice, which is the JavaScript here, Nashorn provides that.”
